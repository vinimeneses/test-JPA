# Introductory Project: Object-Relational Mapping with JPA / Hibernate

Welcome to the Introductory Project on Object-Relational Mapping with JPA / Hibernate! This project from the "Object-Oriented Programming" course by Professor Nélio Alves offers a simple application that explores the fundamental concepts of object-relational mapping using JPA (Java Persistence API) and Hibernate.

## Features

- Demonstrates the mapping of an "Person" entity to a database table.
- Tested the program's functionality with the database.
- Illustrates the use of JPA annotations for mapping classes and properties.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Ensure you have Java, JPA, and Hibernate configured in your environment.

3. Configure the `persistence.xml` file to specify the database connection settings.

4. Execute the main program that demonstrates object-relational mapping.

5. Observe how the application creates and manipulates objects of the "Person" type and persists them in the database.

# Technologies Used

## Back-End

- Java
- JPA (Java Persistence API)
- Hibernate
- SQL
- Xampp

This project provides an introduction to the principles of object-relational mapping with JPA / Hibernate and serves as a solid foundation for exploring more advanced topics related to Java application development with data persistence.
